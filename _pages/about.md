Mourad Khayati is a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. Prior to that he was a Senior Researcher in the eXascale Infolab group at the same university. 
He obtained his PhD from the <a href="http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/dbtg/">University of Zurich</a>, Switzerland, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/dbtg/Staff/Boehlen.html">Prof. Michael B&ouml;hlen</a>. 
His research interests lie in the field of Time Series analytics, with a special focus on
data cleaning, missing values imputation, and large-scale data management. 

He regularly serves in the review boards of top-tier database and data engineering venues, including the VLDB Journal, TKDE, KDD, and EDBT. He has served as a Senior Program Committee member for KDD 2026, KDD 2025, and CIKM 2020, and has mentored PhD students at several conferences, such as EDBT,
CIKM and WISE. He led several projects, including a H2020 project and an SNF/DFG collaboration with TU Berlin. Over the years, he developed a number of time series tools, made them open-source, and actively participated in promoting reproducibility.
